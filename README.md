# The Dynamics of Escape Attempts from Quick, Intelligent Pursuers, or: Surviving the Velocipocalypse

Please be informed: if this repository is to be taken down, you will know it has begun.

## What is this?

This analysis and report is intended to illuminate one facet of the sorts of considerations one should take when faced with adversarial velociraptors. In particular, we intend to make clear the physical limitations of the human body against a pursuing velociraptor (or indeed any pursuer) and how one may improve their physical condition to maximize their survivability in such a scenario.

This analysis is inspired by and based upon [a webcomic published by Randall Munroe of xkcd](https://xkcd.com/135/).

## Why do I need to know?

We're sure you've seen Jurassic Park or any of the recent incarnations of the series. Fleeing dinosaurs is a frenetic and paralyzing experience. Our mission is to give you access to the tools you need to survive _before_ you need them, and start the conversation about this frightening eventuality. We are serious, and you should be, too.

## Other Thoughts

We encourage peer review in this context as this will illuminate any faults in our logic and improve the analysis to everyone's benefit. Please approach us with any considerations, updates, critiques, etc. as long as you are respectful. Thanks!
